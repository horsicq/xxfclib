/* Raw DEFLATE (RFC 1951), no zlib/gzip wrapper. This is what a ZIP member
 * stored with method 8 contains. The no-dependency rule forbids linking zlib,
 * so the algorithm is implemented here.
 *
 * Inflates pSource[0..nSourceSize) into pOut. nExpectedSize is the known
 * uncompressed size (from the ZIP header) and is used to bound the output so
 * a corrupt stream cannot grow without limit; pass 0 if unknown. nMaxSize is
 * an absolute ceiling on the output, mirroring the nDecompressedLimit of
 * XArchive::decompress: decoding stops once that many bytes are produced and
 * the truncated result is a success; pass 0 for no ceiling. Returns 1 on
 * success, 0 on any malformed input. On success pOut holds the bytes and its
 * NUL terminator is in place.
